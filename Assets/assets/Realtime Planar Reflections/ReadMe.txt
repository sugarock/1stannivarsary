Thank you for downloading Realtime Planar Reflections! :)

Support features:
1. Blurred and clean reflection.
2. Bumped reflection based on normal map.
3. Mask reflection region based on texture.
4. Height fading reflection effect.

How to setup?
=> Attach script "PlanarReflection.cs" to your ground plane.
=> Set all necessary inspectors, please refer demo scene as example.
=> All extra features are built on top of unity3d built-in surface shader, so all built-in standard features are compatible.
The demo scene demonstrates all features, open and play it.
